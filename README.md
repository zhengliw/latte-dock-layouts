# latte-dock-layouts

Nice and eye-candy layouts for your latte-dock.

# How to use

Go to any dock/panel, click dock/panel settings, and then click the Latte icon (yep that's actually a button).

In the next popping up window, click "Import" on the right-hand side of the window and choose the downloaded layout file.

# Latte dock is awesome.

I hope you enjoy the work from the devs of latte-dock!!!
